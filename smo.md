**Q: I can't mod my Switch, how can I practice?**
> **A: You can setup practice files using multiple Switch profiles.**

**Q: Why do you change the time to 1:53 AM in the system settings before a run?**
> **A: This instantly grows a seed in Sand Kingdom that triggers Daylight Savings 7 minutes after the timer starts, jumping the time forward by an hour.** Casually, you'd have to wait for this seed to grow over time, but it will grow instantly once you enter a subarea and back out of it.

**Q: Are emulators allowed?**
> **A: Not on speedrun.com**, but you can use one for the [**practice mod**](https://github.com/fruityloops1/smo-practice-2/releases)!

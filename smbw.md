## Main
**Q: Digital or Physical?**
> **A: Digital has faster loads**. Mizu estimates that a physical copy loses 10s in 100%.

**Q: Switch or Switch 2?**
> **A: Switch 2 is faster** (~2m in 100% and ~50s in NMG), but is banned in Any% due to a firmware update making v1.0.0 unplayable.

**Q: Fastest character?**
> **A: Toadette and Yoshi in 100%**
> 1. Fast navigation in the character select screen
> 2. Yoshi saves 5s in Invisibility I
>
> **Any powerup viable character in NMG and Any%**
> * **In Any%, Yoshi as player 2** saves time as he can tongue coins and items
>   * Starting in 2 player also saves time as you don't need to pause the game, reconnect player 2's controller and select their character

**Q: How do you deal with Jet Run?**
> **A:**
> 1. Crouching + holding left and right repeatedly
> 2. Using the emote menu by holding Y
> 3. Leaning against walls

**Q: Why do you hold A while getting powerups?**
> **A: The collected item doesn't override the reserve item** for extra flower coins or to save it for later.

**Q: Why don't you clip out of bounds? It's faster!**
> **A: They're only allowed for Any%.**

**Q: What are the fastest routes?**
> **A: Generally, the fastest routes do the worlds in order**. Some runners do 465 to get W6 out of the way which is 2s slower.
>
> **100% - All worlds in order + two W1 revisits**
> * Skip World 1's shop at the start to buy postgame badges later
> * Unlock Jet Run as fast as possible, clean up most of World 1 then do the rest of the worlds in order
> * After main game, enter Piranha Plants on Parade for the 1st coin + its secret exit with Jet Run
> * Visit the World 1 shop and buy its Wonder Seed + postgame badges
>
> **Any% - The game checks only if you've beaten World 4, 5 and 6. With this in mind:**
> * Play the first three levels with Yoshi as player 2
> * After Badge House, perform World 1 Skip
> * Collect Wonder Seeds in Petal Isles to unlock World 4
> * After Raise the Stage, warp back to Petal Isles to play World 5 and 6
> * Warp back to World 4 to buy the last Wonder Seeds needed to unlock the palace

**Q: What can I expect with Badges?**
> **A: Jet Run is the most important Badge, except in Any% where it's Fast Dash.** Both have a horizontal speed cap except in a star where Fast Dash is faster.

**Q: What game version are you using?**
> **A:**
> * **v1.0.0 on Switch 1** for Any% and practice using the [**Practice Mod**](https://gamebanana.com/mods/626696) created by me and Codek
> * **v1.0.2 on Switch 2** for runs to take advantage of its loads

**Q: How do I revert back to v1.0.0?**
> **A: It's near impossible to use v1.0.0 on Switch 2 due to a firmware update making v1.0.0 cartridges unplayable, but for Switch 1:**
> * [**Digital - a hacked Switch is needed**](https://switch.hacks.guide)
> * **Physical - with a factory reset**

> [!WARNING]
>   * **BACK UP YOUR SAVE DATA FIRST IF YOU PLAN ON USING v1.0.0 PHYSICALLY!**

**Q: Are there any differences between the game versions?**
> **A: There's an unpatched World 5 clip in v1.0.1 using a ? Block** (not tested on v1.0.2).

**Q: Fastest language?**
> **A:**
> * **Simplified Chinese Talking Flowers** by starting a file, using the in-game settings and restarting the game
> * **Spanish text** via system language
> * While not the fastest language, in 100% I use English text for Taily's Toxic Pond's quiz

**Q: How do you practice without music?**
> **A:**
> 1. [**This mod**](https://gamebanana.com/sounds/70994) removes level and title screen music
> 2. [**This mod**](https://gamebanana.com/sounds/71558) removes the world map music
>
> Both require a modded Switch to use.

**Q: Who made your split backgrounds?**

## 100%
**Q: What are 100%'s requirements?**
> **A: 100% obtains all 6 medals on a save file by**
> * **beating the game** (finishing Bowser's Rage Stage)
> * **collecting all Wonder Seeds**
> * **collecting all 10-flower coins**
> * **grabbing the top of the flagpole at least once in the main levels**
> * **collecting all 24 Badges**
> * **collecting all 144 Standees**

**Q: What is the difference between 100% and 100% No Standees?**
> **A:** Like what its name says, **100% No Standees is 100% without standees**. It isn't a true 100% category, but standees are RNG heavy so some prefer to run No Standees.

**Q: Standee RNG highly influences a run, so how does that work?**
> **A:**
> * Before reaching 100 standees, you buy standees that give you a random chance of getting one which cost 10 flower coins each
> * It's best to buy guaranteed standees after reaching 100 standees, which cost 30 flower coins each

**Q: Why do you get so many flower coins?**
> **A: To minimize coin grinding from Coin Galores at the end**, which add up over the long run. An extra Coin Galore loses about a minute each.

**Q: Why do you swap to the Badge Challenge's badge before entering it?**
> **A: You skip a textbox after beating the level asking if you'd like to equip the badge.** Though it only saves 1.5s each time, this also adds up over the long run and saves 16.5s overall after doing it 11 times.

## Any% No Major Glitches
**Q: What is the goal of this category?**
> **A: Beat the game without the use of out of bounds clips.**

**Q: What's the fastest route?**
> **A: The fastest route gets Jet Run in World 1 then beats the rest of the main worlds as fast as possible.** For a while, it was unknown if Jet Run was faster because it loses 2 minutes leaving World 1, but it was later found that it saves ~40s over the long run.

**Q: How tight is the flower coin routing?**
> **A: At a top level, you only have a 5 coin buffer before you'll need backup 10-flower coin.**

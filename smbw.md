## Main

**Q: Digital or Physical?**
> **A: Digital has faster loads**. Mizu estimates that a physical copy loses 10s in 100%

**Q: Switch or Switch 2?**
> **A: Switch 2 is faster** (~2m in 100% and ~50s in NMG), but is banned in Any% due to a firmware update making v1.0.0 unplayable

**Q: Fastest character?**
> **A: Toadette and Yoshi in 100%**
> 1. Fast navigation in the character select screen
> 2. Yoshi saves 5s in Invisibility I
>
> **Any powerup viable character in NMG and Any%**
> * **Yoshi in Any%** as player 2 saves time as he can tongue coins and items
>   * Starting a run in 2p also saves time as you don't need to pause the game, reconnect player 2's controller and select their character 

**Q: How to deal with Jet Run?**
> **A:**
> 1. Crouching + holding left and right repeatedly
> 2. Using the emote menu by holding Y
> 3. Leaning against walls

**Q: Why hold A while getting powerups?**
> **A: The collected item doesn't override the reserve item** for extra flower coins or to save it for later

**Q: Why not clip out of bounds? It's faster!**
> **A: They're only allowed for Any%**

**Q: Route?**
> **A: Generally, the fastest routes do the worlds in order**. Some runners do 465 to get W6 out of the way which is 2s slower.
>
> **100% - All worlds in order + two W1 revisits**
> * Skip World 1's shop at the start to buy postgame badges later
> * Unlock Jet Run as fast as possible, clean up most of World 1 then do the rest of the worlds in order
> * After main game, enter Piranha Plants on Parade for the 1st coin + its secret exit with Jet Run
> * Visit the World 1 shop and buy its Wonder Seed + postgame badges
>
> **Any% - The game checks only if you've beaten World 4, 5 and 6. With this in mind:**
> * Play the first three levels with Yoshi as player 2
> * After Badge House, perform World 1 Skip
> * Collect 10 Wonder Seeds in Petal Isles to unlock World 4
> * After Raise the Stage, warp back to Petal Isles to play World 5 and 6
> * Warp back to World 4 to buy the last Wonder Seeds needed to unlock the palace

**Q: What can I expect with Badges?**
> **A: Jet Run is the most important Badge, except in Any% where it's Fast Dash.** Both have a horizontal speed cap except in a star where Fast Dash is faster

**Q: What game version are you using?**
> **A:**
> * **v1.0.0 on Switch 1** for Any% and practice using the [**Practice Mod**](https://gamebanana.com/mods/626696) created by me and Codek
> * **v1.0.2 on Switch 2** for runs to take advantage of its loads

**Q: How do I revert back to v1.0.0?**
> **A: It's near impossible to use v1.0.0 on Switch 2 due to a firmware update making v1.0.0 cartridges unplayable, but for Switch 1:**
> * [**Digital - a hacked Switch is needed**](https://switch.hacks.guide)
> * **Physical - with a factory reset**

> [!WARNING]
>   * **BACK UP YOUR SAVE DATA FIRST IF YOU PLAN ON USING v1.0.0 PHYSICALLY!**

## Main
**Q: What is the best character + kart combo?**
> **A: For the most part, the following *flyweight* characters**
> * **Para-Biddybud**
> * **Swoop**
> * **Baby Peach**
> * **Baby Daisy**
>
> and either the **R.O.B. H.O.G.** or **Mach Rocket** is the meta in Mogi Lounge for its best overall stats, but **many of the vehicle combos used at the WR level in Time Trials** are also great options.
>
> I personally use **Para-Biddybud** and the **Mach Rocket** because many players already use **Swoop** like he's the second coming of Funky Kong from Mario Kart Wii omE

**Q: You say a *flyweight* character alongside the R.O.B. H.O.G. or Mach Rocket has the best overall stats, how do you know this?**
> **A:** This is based on the [**Mario Kart World Combo Builder**](https://mkworldbuilder.com/stats) and you can check out more detailed character or vehicle statistics, extensive data analysis and hidden stat info in [**The Mario Kart World Statpedia**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EQd2XYGlB3EFFNE-35hFLaBzJo4cipU9DZT4MRSjBlc/edit).

**Q: You're a speedrunner, why did you choose to play Mogi Lounge over Time Trials or other speedruns?**
> **A: I felt like picking up something new that wasn't speedrunning and I'm more of a long category enjoyer.** I might try 30 Tracks one day, but I've had the idea of committing to a single track and grinding for WR that way. I haven't started this because I don't know what track I'd like to grind and optimizing by the frame will definitely be challenging.

**Q: So what's your goal with Mogi Lounge? Are you trying to reach a specific rank?**
> **A: Nope, this is my first time playing competitive Mario Kart so I'm going in without any goals in mind.** Whatever happens will happen and I'm mainly doing this for the love of the game =)

**Q: Why are you only getting into Mogi Lounge now? I thought you played Mario Kart Wii every now and then.**
> **A:** It might just have to do with the *"$wag money movement" -Twirly*
>
> **Genuinely speaking, I really like how well this game moves compared to the past entries in the Mario Kart series.** Rails, charge jumping, you name it. I also think that the item pool and mechanics are pretty balanced, so with Mario Kart World being a super recent addition, the community is as active as it could be so I will take advantage of the time that is there!

**Q: Where'd you get the image that you're using to hide the room code?**
> **A: [THE DUDE NOBODY INVITED:](https://twitter.com/nerdkaykay/status/1991993289978061193)**

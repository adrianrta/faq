## Main
**Q: What is your hardest demon?**
> **A: [Sonic Wave Infinity](https://youtu.be/0C3vaSYTQIQ)** in my opinion, but [**Sinister Silence**](https://youtu.be/WK2mjdh1XUw) according to [**Pointercrate**](https://pointercrate.com/demonlist). As of 2025, I've retired from top level play so please don't expect me to beat list demons at this point!

**Q: What is your top 5?**
> **A: Ranked in my opinion -**
> 1. [**Sonic Wave Infinity**](https://youtu.be/0C3vaSYTQIQ) [11/29/23]
> 2. [**The Golden**](https://youtu.be/kHsWCzmwI-w) [5/2/23]
> 3. [**Tartarus**](https://youtu.be/TSHTbd5edZc) [8/23/22]
> 4. [**Oblivion**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1671721641) [12/5/22]
> 5. [**Sinister Silence**](https://youtu.be/WK2mjdh1XUw) [1/7/24]

**Q: Hardest demons you beat during their times?**
> **A:**
> * [**Zodiac**](https://youtu.be/nKraoWpF6w8) when it was #6
>   * With Hard Machine being overrated at the time, I'd say it's only fair for me to say that I beat it when it was top 5
> * [**Tartarus**](https://youtu.be/TSHTbd5edZc) when it was #9
> * [**Oblivion**](https://twitch.tv/videos/1671721641) when it was #8
>   * Fluke from 65%

**Q: What's your Pointercrate name?**
> **A:** I'm [**adrian**](https://pointercrate.com/demonlist/statsviewer?player=33843) on Pointercrate
> * I peaked at #62 worldwide with ~1290 list points.

**Q: What other completions are you very proud of?**
> **A:**
> * [**Cognition**](https://youtu.be/VO0Tbz3hl60) - #22 at the time of completion, on 2/22/22
> * [**Ouroboros**](https://youtu.be/hOAfgMQjrfg) - #23 at the time + hardest 144Hz completion

**Q: What is your best and longest fluke?**
> **A:**
> * **Best fluke** - [**Oblivion**](https://twitch.tv/videos/1671721641) from 65%
> * **Longest fluke** - [**Eon**](https://twitch.tv/videos/2154772201) from 53%

**Q: What was your first and least favorite extreme?**
> **A:**
> * **First extreme** - 8o X
> * **Least favorite extreme** - [**kowareta**](https://youtu.be/SA6uA7YDD4w)

**Q: How did you first hear about Geometry Dash?**
> **A: I saw another friend play it on his phone** and I of course had to try it myself.

**Q: Is 280Hz worth it?**
> **A: 100%**. With VSync, you can have the same amount of input delay vs. 288 FPS bypass while getting the smoothness of VSync. 3x and 4x speed parts got easier from the extra frames I can see and react to and even if I rarely play now, having 280Hz is still nice.

**Q: What mod menu are you using?**
> **Mega Hack v7 or v8**
> * Has features such as a Start Position Switcher and speedhack for practice

**Q: If you were to beat an extreme again, what would you beat?**
> **A: It would likely be a 2 player extreme with my good buddy Lucidium.**

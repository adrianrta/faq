## Main
**Q: Digital or Physical?**
> **A: Physical has slower loads, but 99% of players use it due to Digital being a Wii U Virtual console rerelease.**

**Q: What's the fastest console to run on?**
> **A: Wiis are known to have inconsistent loads compared to each other. From fastest to slowest (average loads):**
> * **Wii RVL-101 ("Side Wii")** - 2:03-2:06
> * **Wii U (Physical)** - 2:09-2:12
> * **Wii RVL-001 (GameCube Wii)** - 2:09-2:13
> * Wii U Virtual Console (Digital) runs are not retimed without loads.
>
> I currently use a Wii U, but I hope to trade Wiis with Cads sometime in the future.

**Q: What's with the 4:3 aspect ratio?**
> **A: Skippy accidentally discovered that some level unlocks, most notably 8-Airship is faster due to a shorter camera scroll, saving 1.933s.**

**Q: Why do you use the Super Guide block before a run?**
> **A: When a Luigi Super Guide replay starts, the RNG value always changes to a specific value.** By resetting the console and opening a file where the intro cutscene has been watched, the overworld goomba Fred will always be in the same corner depending on what level the Luigi Super Guide block was hit in. This is used to
> * avoid an encounter when going to 1-5 or 1-6
> * get the fastest movements leading up to 1-Cannon
>   * Fred may need to turn before moving to the next corner, which loses frames depending on how much he turns

**Q: Does it matter where you grab the flagpole?**
> **A: No**, unlike other 2D Marios grabbing any part of the flagpole doesn't lose time.

**Q: What's bombless?**
> **A: It's a strategy in 8-Airship that skips using the bombs in the Bowser Jr. fight.** A single bombless can save 10s and an optimal bombless (coding double) saves up to 23s.

## 100%
**Q: What are the fastest routes?**
> **A: 100% is routed to use**
> * **the penguin suit in horizontal levels**
> * **the propeller suit in vertical levels**
>
> **as much as possible.** I currently use the fastest route that doesn't use penguin in 6-6 for consistency reasons, though I plan on switching once I get a sub 3. The fastest route uses an item house to play as penguin in more levels which only the WR uses, but it has a 1 in 3 chance for the most optimal items so 2 in 3 runs end up resetting there.

**Q: What is the fastest language?**
> **A:** Thankfully, **there is no fastest language** due to the text not scrolling when it appears. So if you own a copy of the game, you're already on the fastest version!

**Q: What mods do you use to practice?**
> **A:**
> * [**NSMBW Practice Mode**](https://github.com/RoadrunnerWMC/NSMBW-Practice-Mode/releases)
> * [**IL Mod**](https://github.com/RoadrunnerWMC/NSMBW-ILs-Mod/releases/latest), used to reset levels faster while grinding IL records
> * An **input display mod** can be found pinned in *#general* in the [**NSMBW Speedrunning Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/XfGPJmp)

**Q: Can you skip the credits?**
> **A: No**, the game doesn't save until after. You can shave off a few seconds by pressing the reset button on the Wii right when the game saves, but this is a Wii exclusive timesave due to the Wii U not having a reset button.

**Q: Why is World 7's second half in 1 split?**
> **A: The level order is dependent on the overworld Lakitu's (Ned) position so that encounters can be avoided. [See the patterns here!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uCsxPuMsgUkdX0-OiHb8w0jcOql53hbXHc_GszNCWZw/edit)**

**Q: What glitches are in the run?**
> **A:**
> * **3-Ghost House Secret Exit Clip**
> * **3-Ghost House Normal Exit Clip**
> * **3-Tower Coin 3 Clip**
> * **3-5 Secret Exit Skip**
> * **3-Castle LCK (Left Corner Kick)**
>
> All of these save 30s each, except for the **3-Ghost House Normal Exit Clip** that only saves 2s.

**Q: What's fishless?**
> **A: It's a 1 in 6 16s timesave that avoids the World 4 overworld fish Ted.** You can only avoid him if he's in the center of the dock by the time you enter the split path.

**Q: What's the hardest part of the run?**
> **A: It's the 2nd half for sure**, you can play close to your sum of best easily in the first hour. The more tricks you implement into World 3, the harder it gets, but World 3 in general is already fairly difficult.

**Q: Is the run over if you lose a power up?**
> **A: Most likely, the answer is yes**, but some levels have backup powerups. It's the reason why I use the item house in my runs despite my route not requiring it, so I can build consistency over the long run.

**Q: What's the background in your layout?**
> **A: I use Wallpaper Engine via a window and add it as a source to OBS.**
